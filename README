This is a simple tool to parse an ACPI PPTT into something a little
more readable.  It will follow the links between elements for you.

The tool started from the idea the on some systems, we would get very
different info from /proc/cpuinfo, lscpu, ls-topo and even dmidecode.
On ARM systems, because there is no equivalent to the x86 CPUID data,
the PPTT is used.  So, I use this tool to look at a PPTT and then compare
it to the info provided by the other sources when there is a discrepancy.
